# Example Orchestration Usage
# This file demonstrates how to use the traffic light orchestration system

examples:
  - name: "Holiday Code Freeze"
    scenario: "Managing holiday deployment freeze period"
    current_signal: redlight
    reason: "Code freeze in effect for holiday period"
    actions:
      - "Block all production deployments"
      - "Alert team about freeze period"
      - "Document freeze schedule"
      - "Set up monitoring for critical issues only"
    
  - name: "Post-Holiday Review"
    scenario: "Reviewing accumulated changes after holiday"
    current_signal: yellowlight
    reason: "Multiple PRs pending review after holiday break"
    actions:
      - "Assess backlog of changes"
      - "Prioritize critical reviews"
      - "Monitor for conflicts"
      - "Schedule code review sessions"
    
  - name: "Routine Feature Deployment"
    scenario: "Standard feature ready for production"
    current_signal: greenlight
    reason: "All tests pass, reviews approved, no blockers"
    actions:
      - "Deploy to production"
      - "Monitor metrics post-deployment"
      - "Notify stakeholders of completion"
      - "Update documentation"

workflow_simulation:
  day_1:
    signal: redlight
    event: "Critical bug discovered in production"
    actions: ["Stop deployments", "Create incident", "Alert team"]
    
  day_2:
    signal: yellowlight
    event: "Bug fix deployed, monitoring for issues"
    actions: ["Monitor metrics", "Review logs", "Document fix"]
    
  day_3:
    signal: greenlight
    event: "No issues detected, system stable"
    actions: ["Resume normal operations", "Close incident", "Schedule retrospective"]

holiday_specific_rules:
  thanksgiving:
    default_signal: yellowlight
    duration: "4 days"
    reason: "Reduced team availability"
    
  christmas:
    default_signal: redlight
    duration: "7 days"
    reason: "Extended holiday break, minimal support"
    
  new_year:
    default_signal: yellowlight
    duration: "3 days"
    reason: "Team ramping back up"
